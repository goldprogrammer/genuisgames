	<ul>
		<li class="outer">At least three of the following:
			<ul>
				<li>numbers</li>
				<li>capital letters</li>
				<li>lower letters</li>
				<li>symbols</li>
				<li>symbols in the middle</li>
			</ul>
		<li class="outer">
		To better remember your password, use a passphrase such as "where's the beef?"  This could become "Wh D@ b33f?"  this would let you remember the passphrase, but still have a secure password
		</li>
		<li class = "outer">
		In addition, you can add extensions on the end of you password to make it more secure.  Some of examples of this include:
			<ul>
				<li>Gmail="gma"</li>
				<li>Spotify="Spo"</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li class = "outer">Your password should be at least ten characters, but for better security you should have 12-15 characters</li>
		<li class = "outer">If you are a admin of a system, it is recommended that you change your password every thirty days, but if your are a user, then you should change your password every 90 days.</li>
		<li class = "outer">One password counts as one factor authentication, but for more security, use an additional method of security such as a biometric scanner</li>
