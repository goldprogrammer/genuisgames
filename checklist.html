	<ul>
		<li>At least three of the following:
			<ul>
				<li>numbers</li>
				<li>capital letters</li>
				<li>lower letters</li>
				<li>symbols</li>
				<li>symbols in the middle</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
		To better remember your password, use a passphrase such as "where's the beef?"  This could become "Wh D@ b33f?"  this would let you remember the passphrase, but still have a secure password
		</li>
		<li>
		In addition, you can add extensions on the end of you password to make it more secure.  Some of examples of this include:
			<ul>
				<li>Gmail="gma"</li>
				<li>Spotify="Spo"</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Your password should be at least ten characters, but for better security you should have 12-15 characters
	</ul>
